        <div class="initial">s anger necessary? Is anger good, neutral, bad, positive, negative or a neutral emotion? In modern day society what is the current consensus on the emotion of anger? What are the merits and demerits of anger if any at all? What is the purpose of humanity? To be as we were created. Does that even matter? Does suppressing an emotion make us less human? Is there anything wrong with being less human? Should these questions be answered from a subjective point of view, or “objectively” from a general point of view? Has anger ever helped you? Is their tyranny in your home? Is anger a necessary emotion against injustice against an evil? Do I and should care about fighting “evil”?</div>
      </div>
      <div class="blog">To sort through all these questions from an objective standpoint would be quite futile. As such, I will do my best to group them, and eliminate them based on personally conceived axioms. 5 questions. That is all.
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>What is the current consensus on the emotion of anger and why?</li>
        <li>What other attributes are caused or associated with the emotion of anger and can they be separated?</li>

        <li>Is anger and/or the corresponding attributes of anger helpful or unhelpful, and if either, in what circumstances? </li>
      </ol>
      4 is enough nvm.<br><br>
      No.1 establishes the status quo, and a most likely reasonable perspective. <br>
      No.2 seeks to salvage any possible good associated with the emotion anger <br>
      No.3 questioning one’s own axioms and becomes the basis to answer the practical applications. <br>
      No.4 questions the practical applications of anger and the associated attributes <br>
      <h1>1. What is the current consensus on the emotion of anger and why?</h1><br><br>
      To begin with, tackling question No.1 us necessary, as the rules of a functioning society are rules for a reason. Perhaps rules is too strong. Maybe ‘guidelines’ that you must follow is more accurate. The first reason is perhaps the simplest, anger can precipitate violence, and violence is already outsourced to the government, and therefore the necessity to integrate anger, a pivotal emotion in the case of a fight is no longer as necessary. The implied axiom is that anger makes it harder for a person to back down and also shows that to everyone else. Within a flight or fight scenario anger causes a person to be more inclined to “fight” despite any fear that they may experience. 
      <br><br>
      Thus, the creation of the ‘civilised’ man was formed, no longer a ruffian that solved things with fists, but with tax money, and the threat of the government’s enforcers… enforcing the law through any means necessary. Yes, we outsource the violence to the government’s enforcers. Sounds patronising no? 
      <br><br>
      Yes... but, that is only the negative part, of course it should be mentioned that by giving up the ‘right’ to settle things with our fists no con-sensually, the safety of the citizen is much better off. The stance of most people is that anger is a force that must be actively controlled, ‘integration’ i.e., for it to be used in a useful manner, is out of the question. There are others who are less, explicit with this belief and instead express the need for one to have an anger outlet for e.g., weightlifting, exercising, etc. The implied message from the society that I live is loud and clear, anger is an inescapable part of the human condition, and it must be managed. Anger is dangerous and must be controlled. Using anger against another human, although tempting, is… immoral, and will not be tolerated….
      <br><br>
      The one caveat is that ‘those in power’, those with more status, are given a free pass. The boss, an older sibling or friend, parents, especially within an Asian culture these power dynamics will be tolerated, both subconsciously and based on the evidence this seems to be true. This statement does not mean that those who use anger are always more respected, it simply means that the society that I live is accepting this as the status quo, and one that will not be overturned for a while. 
      <br>  <br>
      An employee getting angry and expressing it to the boss or the other way around, which do you imagine is more like. This is an observation, judgements are answered in question 4. Is there a point here? Yes. That boss would be considered a ‘bad’ boss as a rule of thumb, however these types of bosses are necessary in a intense work environment such as very ironically, a police department, an senior officer in the army or a head chef, like Gordon Ramsay. Part of the reason why Gordon Ramsay is still respected despite expressing his anger or at least aggression (these differences will be delineated in question 3) is due to his charisma and high level of skills, but also because it is simply necessary in the fast-paced high stakes environment that he works in. A boss with well-integrated aggression/anger results in increased revenue for the company as mistakes/low effort is corrected for very quickly. From personal experience as well my observation this seems to be the case. It should also be noted that this does not seem to be the case for less “intense” workplaces, with comparatively “slow-paced” work… at least from what I have discussed with others. 
      <br><br>
      <h1>2. What other attributes are caused or associated with the emotion of anger and can they be separated?</h1><br><br>
      I’m getting lazy writing this article so…yeh I’m not justifying nor coming up with definitions for these attributes, just using the godly hand of google search. We need a definition of both anger and its counterpart aggression. This came from a quick google search on the definition of anger “Anger, also known as wrath or rage, is an intense emotional state involving a strong uncomfortable and non-cooperative response to a perceived provocation, hurt or threat”.
Another google search of anger and aggression reveals their relation to each other
“ Anger can sometimes lead to people being aggressive or violent but they're not the same. Anger is a feeling, but aggression and violence are actions, Anger can sometimes feel intense and overwhelming, but it doesn't necessarily lead to violent or aggressive behaviour” Wow thanks goggle I am now iNfINIteLY mOrE kNoWlEDgeAble.
After successfully defining anger, all that’s left is to define what aggression is. 
“Aggression is defined as feelings of anger or antipathy resulting in hostile or violent behaviour; readiness to attack or confront.” To avoid a cyclical confusion where both anger and aggression are the same, we can define aggression as simply a readiness to attack or confront.
      <br><br>
      Basically, one can be aggressive without being angry however anger is correlated with aggression and violence. To further describe the levels of aggression, there is a low level, where one simply has a stern tone, that is a descending inflection to their voice, to a high level where they are beating the crap out of you…with their words of course, remember, police are outsourced for violence. 
      <br><br>
      Since the only benefit of being angry, if any at all, would be increased aggression (violence is outsourced), anger needs to be compared with aggression in itself. Yes anger is probably less useful then aggression, as aggression is by default less connected to ones feelings and instead ones external expression and actions, thus making it easier to control, and less probability ‘mistakenly causing harm’.<br><br>
      Non-cooperation. Seems like a positive response in some circumstances. Cool lets move on. This question really wasn’t needed. <br><br>
      <h1>3. What is/are the end/s that one’s emotion should serve, i.e are they an end in itself? Or in service of a greater end?</h1><br><br>
      Question 3 is answered based on personal axioms. Insert generic definition from google: An axiom, postulate or assumption is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments. The word comes from the Greek axíōma (ἀξίωμα) 'that which is thought worthy or fit' or 'that which commends itself as evident. ' 
<br><br>
I do not believe emotions are generally an end in themselves, as there are greater ends that would render emotions comparatively less important. For e.g if one believes as most do, that murder is a bad thing, and after committing a murder they feel happy, the emotion is no longer a good thing even if they are inherently good to a small degree, they are overshaded by another value such as life. In spite of this, I have an attachment to emotions as that is what makes us human. However, whether one actively tries to “manage/control” an emotion it will inevitably exist to the point of sufficiently making us human, in other words this is not a huge worry. In addition, given that the point before is false, I would rather be less human, and still in line with my higher values. In summary emotions do not hold enough value to be define as an “end in itself”. Thus, the following question is, what end are they in service of? I believe my emotions should serve me. It should be to my benefit. So, what do I desire? What do I value? What are my greatest ends?
<br><br>

      <img src="../images/blog_imgs/maslow.jpg" class="article-img" >
      I suppose the easiest way to begin with building blocks is to use other people’s building blocks and in this case that is Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Although the top triangle is quite the green bar, orange and red is a desire for the control of the external and internal environment in a way that contributes to ones mental and physical health. To simplify, it is about control.  The middle bar of “love and belonging”, can be summed up as a sense of connection, and would not fall under control, because it requires a loss of some control, as one needs to be vulnerable generally to establish a sense of connection. <br><br>
To sum up human beings, including me desire a sense of control as well as a sense of connection. The top triangle is about self-growth but is difficult to define as the objective of growth needs to be self-defined. Question 3. Done. Could add to it but no. <br><br>
<h1>4. Is anger and/or the corresponding attributes of anger helpful or unhelpful, and if either, in what circumstances? 
</h1>
  <br><br>

Let’s break this down according to the two axioms. 1. Anger and/or its attributes is more helpful such that it gives me more control. 2. Anger and/or its attributes is more helpful such that it allows me to connect with others more. <br><br>

On Axiom 1. The empirical evidence seems to say that it is helpful.  
<br><br>
“Nicer men earn up to 18.3 percent less than tougher, more aggressive men, according to academic research from three university professors.”  
-washington post
<br><br>
In other words, aggressiveness, which is often triggered by anger = more money, and therefore the bottom of Mazlow’s hierarchy of needs as money is the means by which basic necessities are acquired. Wow cool. Also it should be noted that this effect was only seen to smaller degree in women. I won’t get into why, but it is what it is. It should also be noted that it could be just the case that these people are only aggressive in achieving raises and nicer at all other times. Also, my point from question 2 still stands that is, more intensive work environments such as a law firm or investment bank may be more accepting of disagreeable people, compared to others. Still, the evidence seems to show that aggression is not a completely unhelpful trait. 
<br><br>
 This is not to say that aggression, should be uncontrolled. Rather it should be used according to the environment and type of people one interacts with. The new study published in the Journal of Applied Psychology about different character traits seems to support this stance. It was found that those who have similar levels of agreeableness/disagreeableness tended to “reach agreements faster, perceived less conflict in their relationship, and had more positive impressions of one another as compared to pairs that were less similar on agreeableness or extroversion”. The study theorised that our appreciation for the perceived similarity of the other person, causes the negotiation to be more smooth. 
<br><br>
Now practically speaking anger/aggression is necessary and is definitely endorsed by society as seen in question 1 and by me as well. A new example that hasn’t been mentioned so far is that of a teacher teaching very younger kids, or an adult and a young child.  The police say as long as an adult doesn’t use objects to hit their kids, then it is ok. The adult won’t be arrested. This is of course a clear distinction between the level of aggression that is allowed in the household vs the classroom, but it is evident in both cases. The reasoning is that the child in question has not developed the mental faculties to truly understand when they have done something wrong from a logical argument and instead require an intuitive understanding imparted to them through some sort of aggression from the adult. Of course, it is not as if we endorse adults to do this, but rather that it is necessary to some degree, provided that the adults are able to control themselves…
<br><br>
Axiom 2 would seem to offset how beneficial anger/aggression is. On one hand being angry at a person could communicate ones hurt or how much they care about the other person’s actions/ perspective, on the other hand, it could also backfire, if only anger is interpreted, and the message is lost in translation. Referring to the study of negotiators being better with those of similar dispositions even when both were disagreeable, a possible reason is that there is already a building block in place that makes it easier for the message to be translated so to speak, in that the premise of a negotiation is that there is something person A wants, and person B can give and vice versa. Perhaps, in the absence of such a ‘building block’ all that is left is chaos. On a whole it would seem that aggression is a net negative in terms of building connections, especially in the absence of a ‘building block’ like a mutual understanding. It may seem weird, but a negotiation type atmosphere is very difficult to establish in the average conversation. 
<br><br>
Anger/aggression is usually helpful when it is not directed at other people. It usually will just show others that one is very passionate about something, that they have a moral compass and are vexed because of a certain injustice. As long as one’s entire character isn’t based in ager, generally people can develop a sense of connection around their anger, the lamest example being a hate for tv show, or celebrity. 

<br><br>
Because anger and aggression can precipitate violence, a civilised society will always be apprehensive to the notion that these tendencies can be useful in any way. I do believe that aggression and anger when directed towards one’s work and ambition, can be defined at least from a selfish perspective as good, so long as one does not fester inside these emotions. However, in relation to directing anger at other people, I believe this would be an ill-advised decision in most scenarios. Instead, aggression should be used when needed as aggression is simply the action rather than the feelings which could result in unintended consequences. Still, the main reason aggression should be employed with other people is as a last resort due to an inability to connect with the other person for e.g adult to child, teacher to student. Not to say that it should be used in this certain scenario with an older person and younger child, only that these are the most obvious examples in our society. The only other reason is simply that one has many metaphorical “building blocks” that is there is a mutual understanding and connection that has been formed, as well as both parties having a more disagreeable nature. This is a rare scenario though.  
<br><br>
In the end, anger and aggression is a contentious subject because people view it as a solely bad thing. Yes, indeed, anything that people view as bad is going to be contentious. But in defence of both anger and aggression, they can be used to fuel one’s ambition as well develop a deeper connection with others, even if the net result of always using anger is 10 billion percent bad for society and the individual. I suppose the 5th question would be “how can we change the current superficial understanding of anger and aggression such that our society is better prepared to utilise these traits?” I am hopeful.
