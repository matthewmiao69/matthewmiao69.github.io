      <p>I'm actually both anti-choice and anti-life. I believe all women should have abortions, always.-JREG</p>

      <p>I threw my cup away when I saw a child drinking from his hands at the trough. - Diogenes</p>

      <p>There can be two results, you get cucked, or she falls in love, simple. - Aj Xiang</p><br>
      <p>My life is but a premove. -Aj xiang</p><br>
      <p>I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole. - Reddit</p><br>
      <p>You tried your best that's all that matters - Tony Lang</p><br>
      <p>I don't include you inside my calculations - Matthew Lin</p><br>
